## Options

- **Make height with multiple colliders**: Create a capsule-collider like shape by multiple colliders instead of height property of DynamicBone.
- **Attach SpringBones to secondary object**: Add SpringBones not to the objects DynamicBones are originally appended but to `secondary` object of VRM model.


# Parameter tuning üßÇ

Helper GUI for tuning parameters. This feature is provided for SpringBone only for now to support the workflow of DynamicBone to VRM SpringBone conversion. Select bones and parameters and configure them. The value changed is applied realtime.
